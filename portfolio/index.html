      <div class="hobby">
        <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i>
        <p>I started learning electronics when I was eight years old. I gained basic skills at the Children's Tech Center. Unfortunately, the center closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic but has since reopened as the Edison Club (I don't take this class anymore). During this time, I also discovered a passion for computer programming, an interest further detailed below. Recently, in the final months of seventh grade, I completed a project where I built a smart dustbin that categorizes waste into three types: biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and electronic. This was achieved using a camera to capture images of the waste, which my program then analyzes to determine the appropriate category. The purpose of this project was for an expo in Mumbai called the World Young Innovators Expo, where it won two awards; however, after looking at it, my school decided to set it up for another expo called CIIA. After that expo, my school decided to set it up for a patent, and I currently have 2 patents for the project. After moving to Berlin, Germany, I have been attending an online electronics class by Arcomm.</p>

        <i class="fas fa-code"></i>
        <p>During covid, my mom introduced me to something called as command prompt, this introdoced the computer science and sparked my intrest in it. Later on, a friend of mine told me about something called as code.org, from which I began to learn coding. After compeleting my course on code.org, I began learning python by course on my dad's oreily account.</p>
